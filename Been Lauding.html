<p class="p1">Lyrics:</p>
<p class="p1">Digery Do you remember November’s blunder</p>
<p class="p1">down under Dun D plunders cause chunder</p>
<p class="p1">while lightning n thunder is [sic] very very frightening</p>
<p class="p1">Galileo Galilea learned from his balcony</p>
<p class="p1">Heretical heleocentric epiphanies</p>
<p class="p1">not just theoretical, listen to me</p>
<p class="p1">From the narcs to the sharks</p>
<p class="p1">I want freedom from oligarchs</p>
<p class="p1">Olive branches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">they hand us</p>
<p class="p1">while they ban us</p>
<p class="p1">from standing in crowds, planning out loud,</p>
<p class="p1">canning the proud, they ranch us like cows</p>
<p class="p1">for the slaughter</p>
<p class="p1">like the daughter whose dress her father bought her</p>
<p class="p1">to supress how he fought her unless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">she gave him respect</p>
<p class="p1">He suspects she’d be better as another man’s mess</p>
<p class="p1">It’s my guess, it must be thus for the rest of us</p>
<p class="p1">They take all our freedom give some back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">we say thank you</p>
<p class="p1">They take all our freedom give some back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">we say thank you</p>
<p class="p1">They take all our freedom give some back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">we say</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Scratching and scrawling</p>
<p class="p1">that shit's enthralling</p>
<p class="p1">but batshit appalling like habit cat calling</p>
<p class="p1">what's the purpose? To hurt us? To hearse us? To coffin curse us?</p>
<p class="p1">Your coffers and purses, pursed lips and churches</p>
<p class="p1">take tithes to skirt bits of taxes</p>
<p class="p1">which congress then relaxes.</p>
<p class="p1">I've got a long list of anglo saxes hijacking funds and guns</p>
<p class="p1">the labor of you and your neighbor</p>
<p class="p1">not for fun but because we let them, son.</p>
<p class="p1">They're no different than us yet they're indifferent towards us.</p>
<p class="p1">Poor us. Can't afford room and board thus we're joined at the hip</p>
<p class="p1">to the pyramid tip.</p>
<p class="p1">The all seeing eye spies on our lives, binds us guys in trusted lies.</p>
<p class="p1">Busted minds supervise thus any evil flies and inequality will rise.</p>
<p class="p1">Do you realize what's funny?</p>
<p class="p1">"In God we Trust" is printed all over our money!</p>
<p class="p1">Religion is tinted by suspicions invented</p>
<p class="p1">over the course of a long pattern of abuse:</p>
<p class="p1">a strong shattering of truth.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course I want to be ruthless,</p>
<p class="p1">but in the end I feel toothless.</p>
<p class="p1">The overarching theme there seems to be to me from those pulling the levers is</p>
<p class="p1">Oligarchy Kinds and Queens are keen on being unopposed rulers forever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It seems like 'Merika 's in a rush ta resign ta</p>
<p class="p1">being comparable to Russia or China</p>
<p class="p1">Give us serfdom call it freedom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">When on their turf, how could we beat 'em?</p>
<p class="p1">We don't need 'em. That's how we defeat 'em.</p>
<p class="p1">We deplete 'em. Deprive them of our lives.</p>
<p class="p1">Plant the seed for the need for us to rise.</p>
<p class="p1">They deceived us, but we are growing wise. See</p>
<p class="p1">We need to talk about</p>
<p class="p1">defect distribution.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a walk about,</p>
<p class="p1">the fact 's our institution</p>
<p class="p1">likes to chalk our doubt</p>
<p class="p1">up to plain confusion.</p>
<p class="p1">Like we're losing 'cause we're choosing</p>
<p class="p1">wage theft, laziness, wage slave craziness, days bereft</p>
<p class="p1">one slip 'n you're out on the street</p>
<p class="p1">as if billionaires care if you eat.</p>
<p class="p1">It's not fair to say they share and we suckle the teat.</p>
<p class="p1">They got there while we hustle and they cheat.</p>
<p class="p1">If wealth chasms got you rustled, then speak.</p>
<p class="p1">'Cause right now all I hear are muffled little ekes!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I got shit to say</p>
<p class="p1">If you gunna listen there’s a price to pay</p>
<p class="p1">It’s capital listen</p>
<p class="p1">I left the capital christened</p>
<p class="p1">Hissin' just as pistons as they quicken</p>
<p class="p1">Capital H Him gives in to givin’ visions across distance</p>
<p class="p1">In an instant a vision of capitalism with its fist in</p>
<p class="p1">your kitchen. Needing your dough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">while you’re kneeding your dough.</p>
<p class="p1">Though if you work from home for free</p>
<p class="p1">you might not be</p>
<p class="p1">a slave and see</p>
<p class="p1">the same: you a slave remain</p>
<p class="p1">even if paid.</p>
<p class="p1">This fact evaded</p>
<p class="p1">By the prophet Reagan.</p>
<p class="p1">So we turn to Seagan saying</p>
<p class="p1">space age prayin’ is insane and</p>
<p class="p1">Oligarchs send your kids to war.</p>
<p class="p1">Fall apart in the endless war.</p>
<p class="p1">Why not stop?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">What's war for?</p>
<p class="p1">Profits drop unless the rockets roar.</p>
<p class="p1">There 's more.</p>
<p class="p1">Our wars aren't in totality.</p>
<p class="p1">They're used to form mentality.</p>
<p class="p1">We chose to still allow it see?</p>
<p class="p1">Fear controls reality.</p>
<p class="p1">In those fatal hours</p>
<p class="p1">after those twin towers</p>
<p class="p1">and we chose to cower</p>
<p class="p1">they stood and we allow their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">every wish to be met and yet, who put Al-Qaeda in power?</p>
<p class="p1">Leave your tin foil hat and though the truth is sour,</p>
<p class="p1">let it cleanse your fears here 's the shower.</p>
<p class="p1">A shower? A fire hose.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth of power a pricy white powder - lend your nose.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth of power a pricy white powder - here it goes.</p>
